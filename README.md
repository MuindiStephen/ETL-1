### A Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline Using Apache Kafka and Apache Cassandra
 
**Tools Required:** Python, Apache Kafka, Cassandra, a public Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap)

---

 **Project Description**  
In this hands-on project, I learned how to:
- Stream live weather data from a public API
- Send it through Apache Kafka (a distributed streaming platform)
- Store the data in Cassandra for real-time storage and analysis

**Key steps:**
1. Set up Apache Kafka and Cassandra/MongoDB
2. Connect to a weather data API
3. Implement both a Kafka producer (data sender) and consumer (data receiver/storer)


**Ideal for:**
- Practicing real-time data engineering
- Understanding stream processing
- Applying Kafka in practice
- Exploring NoSQL solutions

 **Skills**  
✔ Connecting to public weather APIs for live data  
✔ Installing/configuring Apache Kafka locally  
✔ Sending real-time data streams to Kafka topics  
✔ Storing streamed data in Cassandra  
✔ Schema design for real-time applications
